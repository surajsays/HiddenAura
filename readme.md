# Positive Petals ðŸŒ±

Positive Petals is a cross-platform application designed to help users break bad habits and build positive behaviors. Each time users resist their cravings and choose healthier actions, their virtual tree grows, symbolizing progress and self-discipline. If they fail to resist, they can confess, causing the tree to wither. At the end of each month, users can evaluate their journey while preserving their tree's growth.

## Features

- **Habit Tracking**: Click "I Will Do It" to grow your virtual tree and resist cravings.
- **Progress Visualization**: A growing tree to symbolize your journey towards self-improvement.
- **Monthly Reflection**: Review your progress without punishing yourself.
- **Confession Mode**: If you falter, confess, and see how it impacts your progress visually.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on web, desktop, and mobile platforms.
- **Offline Mode**: Works seamlessly even without an internet connection.
